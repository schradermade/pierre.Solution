# ðŸ“– Description

This project was created in Week 10 of the Epicodus Coding School, using C#/.NET MVC. The objective was to build a web application for a factory to track the maintenance of their machines.

2. Add in the following code snippet to the new appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
      }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=dr_sillystringz;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
  }
}
```

3. Change the server, port, and user id as necessary. Replace 'YourPassword' with relevant MySQL password (set at installation of MySQL).

# Setup and Use

- copy the repository URL and paste it after this GIT command `git clone {repository url}`
- after opening the repository in your code reader, run `dotnet build`
- once build is complete and no errors are thrown, run `dotnet watch run` in the terminal

  ```

## Database

1. Navigate to the DrSillystringz directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell
2. Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
3. (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update.
